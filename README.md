VetNextDoor: Exotic and Domestic Pet Care Locator (Hackathon Project)

Overview

VetFinder is an ambitious hackathon project aimed at simplifying the search for specialized veterinary care, with a particular focus on exotic pets. While designed to cater to all pet owners, our mission is to ensure that owners of less common pets have equal access to quality care. The project leverages a React frontend, Flask backend, and MongoDB for data storage, but it remains a work in progress. Our goal is to create a seamless, user-friendly platform that connects pet owners with the right veterinarians in their area.

Current Features

Basic Search Functionality: Users can input their location to find nearby veterinarians, but filtering by specialty and pet type is still under development.
Prototype UI: A basic React frontend is in place. It's functional but lacks the polished design and responsiveness we aim for.
Initial Database Setup: MongoDB has been chosen for its flexibility with schema design, which is ideal for our varied data. The database schema is designed, but sample data is limited.
Technologies Used

Frontend: React is used for its component-based architecture, enabling us to build a dynamic and interactive user interface. Current implementation includes basic search and placeholder pages.
Backend: Flask serves as our backend framework, chosen for its simplicity and ability to scale with our project's needs. The Flask app is capable of handling basic API requests but requires further development for full functionality.
Database: MongoDB's non-relational structure allows us to store data on veterinarians and services without a fixed schema, providing the flexibility we need. However, integration between the backend and database is ongoing.
Installation and Setup

As the project is not yet complete, installation and setup are primarily geared towards developers interested in contributing to the project. The setup involves cloning the project repository, setting up a local development environment for React and Flask, and ensuring MongoDB is installed and configured to run locally.

Challenges
Filtering and Advanced Search: One of the main challenges we face is implementing an effective filtering system that can accurately match pet owners with veterinarians based on specialty and pet type.
Data Collection: Gathering comprehensive data on veterinarians, especially those specializing in exotic pets, is time-consuming and currently incomplete.
User Interface: Creating a responsive and intuitive user interface that works well on both desktop and mobile devices is a priority that requires further work.
